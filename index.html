<h1><u>A general formula for problem-solving:</u></h1><br>
<h2>I,</h2><p>Start always with first things first and that is to really understand the problem. Think of it this way if you don't understand the problem you will most likely waste your time by going for the wrong solution and not solving the problem. <em>Time is your friend</em>. If you have time use it to really understand the problem before starting to solve it. If you don't choose the most logical solution that you can come up with. Most of the times when we know cleary what the problem is and what need's to be done, the solution will almost always be obvious, but the key is to understand the problem clearly. Don't rush the process of problem solving. How do you know when you understand a problem? You know when you are able to explain the problem in simple terms so that every person can understand, if you can't explain it you have failed it. And in this case failing to understand the problem usually leads to failing solving it hence you have failed it.<br><br>

A great way to understand problems is to reason from first - principles. Reasoning from first principles is a common way to solve problems in physics. It means to starting your reasoning from the fundamentals or from the things we know without doubt that is true and then continuing reasoning from there with your own thinking. In that way your thinking will likely be truly yours and you may increase your chances of coming up with more original thinking and solutions. The important thing here is to rely solely on your own independent thinking so that you don't borrow your thinking from someone else. Choosing by not do your own reasoning people will often borrow their thinking from other's by asking how others think and then make it their own thinking. Start with roots, then create a strong stock of understanding and after that be open to all the possible bransches that can present the solution for you.
	Some quotes related to this:<br><br>

“If he [Thomas Edison] had a needle to find in a haystack, he would not stop to reason where it was most likely to be, but would proceed at once with the feverish diligence of a bee, to examine straw after straw until he found the object of his search. … Just a little theory and calculation would have saved him ninety percent of his labor.” / Nikola Tesla<br><br>
	
 "If I had an hour to solve a problem I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions"/ Albert Einstein<br><br>
	
"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough" / Albert Einstein<br><br>

“Today’s scientists have substituted mathematics for experiments, and they wander off through equation after equation, and eventually build a structure which has no relation to reality" / Nikola Tesla<hr>

<h2>II,</h2><p>The key here is to not be satisfied with the first solution that comes to your mind, you should brainstorm all possible solutions. Gather them on some paper, document on your computer or on the whiteboard. Do a mindmap. There are no rules here, include even the silly ideas (Sometimes it's that silly idea that really is the solution). People mistake often that the first solution that comes up is the best, sometimes it is because of our powerful intuition, but you should spare that idea and try to play with other ideas. The key word here is play, by playing you alow yourself to be creative and to cross the borders of conformity that is often rigid. Play leads to creative out of the box thinking, so therefore play and do thought experiments if you have time several before you start to dive in and look up more closely at every possible solution.</p><br><hr>
<h2>III,</h2><p>Analyze all your ideas by trying to falsify every single one of them. That one idea that can't be falsified or is quite hard to falsify is the idea that may be the solution. If some idea can't stand the test it may be a weak idea. There is a great possibility that the idea that can't be falsified is the idea that may be the most realistic to work in real life. </p><br><hr>
<h2>IV,</h2><p>Nevertheless when you find an idea that is hard to argue against when it comes to the best solution, then the next step is to execute that solution. Try, experiment and go to action. If you fail then you will become more wiser if you don't fail, well congratulations you have solved the problem!</p><br><hr>
<h2>V,</h2><p>After you have executed the solution you evaluate the result, you look at the pros and cons with your method, what did work and what didn't. How was your thinking process when trying to solve the problems, apply <em>meta-cognition - the thinking of your thinking</em> process when you evaluate so that you can polish up your thinking skills next time you need to solve a problem. Write down your evaluation and spare it for the next time so that you become a little bit wiser at the next upcoming problem.</p><br><hr>

	<p><b>Remember problem solving is the most valuable meta-skill there is because as Karl Popper said: "All life is problem solving".</b></p><br>
